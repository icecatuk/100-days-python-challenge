# 100-Day Python Challenge

Welcome to my 100-day Python challenge repository! This repository documents my journey to improve my Python over the next 100 days. I'll be coding every day for the next 100 days, learning new concepts, solving problems, and building projects using Python.

## Motivation

Python is a versatile and powerful language, and I'm keen to become expert. By committing to this challenge, I want to:

- Strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals.
- Learn new libraries and frameworks.
- Solve coding problems and challenges.
- Build real-world projects to apply my knowledge.

## Structure

In this repository, you'll find:

- Log files (`log.md`) documenting my progress, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
- Code snippets and solutions to coding challenges.
- Projects I'm working on throughout the challenge.

## Resources

Throughout the challenge, I'll be using a variety of resources to learn and practice Python, including:

- Online courses (e.g., Udemy, Coursera, Codecademy).
- Python documentation and official tutorials.
- Coding challenge platforms (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank).
- Books and tutorials recommended by the Python community.

## Goals

By the end of this challenge, I aim to:

- Have a solid understanding of Python syntax, data structures, and algorithms.
- Feel confident in my ability to tackle coding challenges and interview questions in Python.
- Complete several Python projects that demonstrate my skills and creativity.
- Build a strong foundation for further learning and exploration in Python development.

## Follow Along

You're welcome to follow along with my journey! Feel free to:

- Star this repository to show your support.
- Fork this repository if you want to join the challenge or explore the code.
- Open issues or pull requests with suggestions, feedback, or questions.
